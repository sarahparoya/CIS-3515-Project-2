<b><h1>CIS 3515: Assignment Two</b></h1>
 <p>
 This app demonstrates a simple Sign Up Form that you see in a lot of websites/apps. Essentially the user fills out the given fields (name, email, password, password confirmation)
 and if all the fields are entered and the passwords match, it displays a welcome message. Although, if the user does not enter information in all the fields or the passwords
 do not match the app will display an error message. (See screenshots)
